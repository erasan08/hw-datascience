    "Problem Statement: Identifying applicants who are qualified for graduate school is both a time and financially intensive process. "
    "By identifying a handful of quantitative & categorical variables our model's intended goal would be to predict the probability of acceptance"
    "Class rank, GPA & GRE score are traditionally indicative of one's scholatic standing, however these variables are not at all exhaustive."
    "Subjective and other variables not mentioned such as personal connections, community service, and work experience have a significant impact upon the admission process as well."
    "However, since the standards & variability of these indicators is so vast it would be extremely difficult to retrieve meaningful data from these variables"
    "when compared to the uniformity that the previously mentioned variables offer over long periods of time & across national boundaries. By indentifying the probability"
    "with which our stated predictors give us relevant & reliable insight into future applicants based on previous enrollment data, we can save both time & money vetting universal"
    "and standard predictors of academic success, and focus more on subjective factors which will only lead to a more robust, diverse student body."
