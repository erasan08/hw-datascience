    "Answer: Identifying applicants who are qualified for graduate school is both a time and capital intensive process. By identifying a handful of quantitative & categorical variables our model's intended goal would be to predict the probability of acceptance. Class rank, GPA & GRE score are traditionally indicative of one's scholatic standing, however these variables are not at all exhaustive. Subjective and other variables not mentioned such as, but not limited to, personal connections, community service, and work experience have a significant impact upon the admission process as well. However, since the standards of these indicators are so inconsistent it would be extremely difficult to retrieve meaningful data from these variables, especially when compared to the uniformity that the previously mentioned variables offer over long periods of time & across national boundaries . By running statistical analysis on the predictors gps, gre & rank our goal is to more easily predict the probability of future applicants acceptance to or rejection from UCLA's graduate program. Once this analysis is executed admissions committee may be able to use the data to determine which future applicants are worth investing more time & attendtion to, creating a more robust student body, minimizing time & funds dedicated to analysis of thousands of lines of data points, & maximizing time to focus on distinguishing characteristics of applicants.\n"

    "We must first assume that the scales with which all undergraduate insititutions determine GPA and class rank are standard;fForunately as GRE examinations are conducted by one central issuing authority, it is safe to assume GRE scores will be standard across the data set (barring reporting & other unforeseen/uncontrollable errors).One of the first risks we encounter is that we may be missing out on credible applicants where GPA, GRE score & class rank are not repesentative of academic success. Although our analysis may determine how well these 3 variables correlate with each other, we will have to make assumptions afterwards of how much weight the results have compared to subjective, unmeasured credentials. Secondly, by breaking the class rank variable into a discrete, standard data set we may increase the risk of misrepresentation by grouping statistical outliers into 1 of 4 groups\n"

    "Answer: Exploratory analysis methods which can be used to gain insight into the data include (but are not limited to) logistic regression, & graphical interpretation through histograms & box plots. Our first steps would be to determine the distribution of our class rank, GRE and GPA data as well as measures of central tendency & variability. This can be done visually with a histogram and box plot, with our general assumption that the histogram data will be skewed right for all three variables. We can use these method to test for outliers as well. In regards to outliers I believe it would be essential to include them since we already know the outcome of their application process. Outliers will allow us to more accurately determine if our model is a fit for the widest range of applicants. After determining distribution our next step will be to determine the correlation of our variables to one another through logistic regression. We can then determine the weight of the changing of one variable with all others constant through the odds tests to ascertain which variables have the greatest impact on admittance.\n"
